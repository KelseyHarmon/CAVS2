To locally host website
    - have the repository cloned on your machine
    - have python installed
    - run "py -m http.server 8000" in the terminal from the cloned repository folder
    - navigate to "http://localhost:8000" on your web browser
    - make changes to the repository, then refresh browser without closing or refreshing terminal
